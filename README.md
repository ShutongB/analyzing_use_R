# Overview

The software is a simple sales data analysis tool. It allows users to load sales data from a CSV file, calculate total sales and average sales per month, and visualize the sales data using a bar plot. The software consists of several functions that perform specific tasks such as loading data, performing calculations, and generating visualizations. The main function serves as the entry point and orchestrates the different steps of the analysis.

Purpose:
The purpose of this software is to showcase the capabilities of R as a statistical computing and graphics language. It demonstrates how R can be used to load and manipulate data, perform calculations, and generate visualizations for data analysis tasks. The software aims to provide a practical example of how R can be used in a real-world scenario, such as analyzing sales data.}
